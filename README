To reproduce, perform the following steps:

1. clone the repo
2. open in bash/cmd/...
3. execute `quarto render --to html`
   Notice that files `index.qmd` & `about.qmd` render successfully to html. 
   Notice that `experiments/about.qmd` technically renders to html without error*
4. execute `quarto render --to pdf`
   Notice that files `index.qmd` & `about.qmd` render successfully to pdf.
   Notice that `experiments/about.qmd` errors out, producing an error while rendering to pdf.

Notes:

- `quarto render` will render all files to all targets successfully, except for `experiments/about.qmd` to `experiments/about.pdf`.

*not quite true. If the html-file is inspected, the image will not show up, instead creating an empty box.
